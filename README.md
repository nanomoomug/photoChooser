photoChooser
============

Description
-----------

A simple program to select the photos one wants to keep and discard
the rest.

Dependencies
------------

*  [pyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
*  [pyexiv2](http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/)

Status
------

Basic GUI and functionality is working. It lacks the possibility to
configure some stuff, but it should be useful to select the photos one
wants to keep.

I program on this because it seams a little tool that is useful to me
(and possibly to somebody else) and I wanted to learn python, pyQt and
how to use github.
