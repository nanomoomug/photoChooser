Status

Basic GUI and functionality is working, but for now the program is only a stub, e.g. the shortcuts are still obscure and can not be changed, there are some known bugs that have to be solved, basic things like an 'undo' operation are missing, etc.

I program on this because it seams a little tool that is useful to me (and possibly to somebody else) and I wanted to learn python, pyQt and how to use github.
